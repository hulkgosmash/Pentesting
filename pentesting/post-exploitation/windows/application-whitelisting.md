# Application Whitelisting

## General

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# Configure Applocker
## Open Local Group Policy Editor
gpedit.msc
# Navigate to Local Computer Policy -> Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Application Control Policies and select the AppLocker

```
{% endcode %}

## Basic Bypasses

### Trusted Folders

The default rules for AppLocker whitelist all executables and scripts located in C:\Program Files, C:\Program Files (x86), and C:\Windows

```bash
# Search for user-writable folders recursively
accesschk.exe "student" C:\Windows -wus
# Check if directory is executeable
icacls.exe C:\Windows\Tasks
```

### Bypass With DLLs

The default ruleset doesn't protect against loading arbitrary DLLs
