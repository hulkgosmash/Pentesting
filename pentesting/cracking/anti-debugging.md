# Anti-debugging

Ways to protect software:&#x20;

* Exe Packing (Compress a software whilst retaining its ability to execute)
* Anti-Debugging (Prevent debuggers from attaching or analyzing)

### Anti-Anti-Debugging Techniques

Anti-Anti-Debugging is the process of subverting anti-debugging

#### Useful techniques

1. Setting breakpoints on common anti-debugging APIs, eg `IsDebuggerPresent()` and then, patching them
2. Use Anti-anti-debugging plugins

#### Useful x64dbg plugins for Anti Anti-Debugging

* ScyllaHide
* SharpOD

### Patching the Anti-Debugging API

1. Open the program in x64dbg, and Run until the entry point
2. In the command window type `bp IsDebuggerPresent` .
3. Run program again to hit the breakpoint.&#x20;
4. Click on on **run to user code**.&#x20;

#### Use Anti-anti-debugging plugins

1. Install this plugin [https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide/releases](https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide/releases)
2. In both 32bit & 64bit versions of x64dbg go to **Plugins** -> **ScyllaHide** -> **Options** and set the **Profiles loaded:** to be Disabled. Restart to confirm this is disabled by default in both.&#x20;
3. To enable when required. In x64dbg go to **Plugins** -> **ScyllaHide** -> **Load Profile** -> **Basic**. Restarting is not necessary. [   \
