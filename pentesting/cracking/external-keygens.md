# External Keygens

### Workflow in creating an External Keygen

1. Patch the target software to create a self-keygen first
2. Study the disassembly and locate minimal instructions which generate the serial key.
3. Copy those instructions out using CopyToAsm plugin.
4. Paste the copied instructions into the Keygen Template.
5. Modify the instructions of the Keygen Template
6. Run & compare the serial key with the self-Keygenâ€™s serial key
7. Repeat from 2 or 5, until the serial key matches with the self-keygen
