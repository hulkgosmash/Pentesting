# Using Loaders

This is also known as runtime patching. here, you patch the process in memory instead of patching the file. Use a loader to start the program and wait for it to uncompress itself into memory. Loader will then patch the process whilst it is still running in memory.&#x20;

1. Use x64dbg to find the memory address as well as the bytes to patch
   1. Load file and patch as normal
   2. Click **File** -> **Patch File** -> **Export**
2. Use dup2 to create a loader based on the info in 1 above.
   1. Click on **Project** -> New and fill in all values.&#x20;
   2. Right click on the new module and select Add -> Offset Patch.&#x20;
   3. Double click on offset patch, select the target file as the original binary. Choose the Patchmode to be either Virtual Address or Relative Virtual Address.&#x20;
   4. Fill in the **Offset**, **Original Byte** & **Patched Byte** and click **Add** then click **Save.**&#x20;
   5. Click on **Project** -> **Create Loader**. Select **simple loader** then click **Save**.&#x20;
