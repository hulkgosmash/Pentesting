# ARM

## Summary

ARM's development started in the 1980s. In 1983, Acorn Computers created a project called _Acorn RISC Machine_ (ARM), followed by the first ARM1 CPU in 1985. In 1990, Apple Computer, Inc., VLSI Technology, along with Acorn Computers created the company ARM Ltd to further develop ARM processors.

The company ARM doesn't manufacture actual CPUs; they only sell the design and the license of the CPUs to companies, who can then create their own ARM processors.

Today, ARM CPUs are available in both 32 and 64 bits, and they can be found mostly in low-power _Internet of Things_ (IoT) devices, phones, and smart watches due to their low energy requirement.

## Intel vs ARM

The biggest difference between the Intel and ARM processor families is that ARM is a _Reduced Instruction Set Computer_ (RISC) processor, whereas Intel is a _Complex Instruction Set Computer_ (CISC). This means that ARM supports far fewer instructions than Intel.

The distinction between Intel and ARM results in a couple of notable differences. ARM instructions, for example, are a fixed length of either four bytes or two bytes long in _Thumb mode_. This allows for faster instruction processing.

Another major difference between ARM and Intel is that ARM is a _load-store architecture_ and Intel is a _register-memory architecture_. For ARM, this means that we can not operate directly on values in memory. First, we must move a memory value into a register, then we can perform an action and put our new value back into memory.

Finally, ARM also has more registers than Intel. We will learn more about these differences shortly.
