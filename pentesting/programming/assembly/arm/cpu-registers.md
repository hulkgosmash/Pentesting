# CPU Registers

## Summary

Accessing memory (RAM) is typically a slow process for a CPU, so processors always contain a few _registers_, small storage located inside the processor from which data can be accessed extremely fast.

On 32-bit ARM processors, these registers can hold 32 bits (4 bytes). Let's introduce the most common registers used in programs.

On 32-bit ARM processors, these registers can hold 32 bits (4 bytes). Let's introduce the most common registers used in programs.

These sixteen registers are named _R0_ - _R15_. _R0_ - _R10_ are general purpose registers for use with instructions.

While R0 to R10 can be used for anything as specified in the _Application Binary Interface_ (ABI), R0 to R3 are typically used to pass arguments to a function and R0 will store the return value. R7 is used to store the system call number when making system calls.

R11 to R15 are special-purpose registers, each with an alias.

* **FP** (R11 - Frame Pointer)
* **IP** (R12 - Intra-Procedure Scratch Register)
* **SP** (R13 - Stack Pointer)
* **LR** (R14 - Link Register)
* **PC** (R15 - Program Counter)

**Frame Pointer (FP)** and **Stack Pointer (SP)** are used for stack operations, which we'll examine later.

**Intra-Procedure Scratch Register (IP)** can be used by a function to store temporary values.

**Link Register (LR)** points to the return address, and it's updated whenever a function call is made. This is where the function can return.

**Program Counter (PC)** points two instructions ahead, because ARM traditionally used a three-stage instruction pipeline (fetch, decode, execute). This means that when an instruction is executed (execute) by the CPU, the following instruction is being decoded (decode) at the same time, and the next is being read from memory (fetch).

**Current Program Status Register (CPSR)**, holds a bitmask. Every bit in the CPSR is a flag and has a special meaning. This is similar to the EFLAGS register on Intel. Table 1 shows many of the most important flags for us in this Topic.



| **Bit** | **Label** | **Description** |
| ------- | --------- | --------------- |
| 31      | N         | Negative        |
| 30      | Z         | Zero            |
| 29      | C         | Carry           |
| 28      | V         | Overflow        |
| 9       | E         | Data endianness |
| 5       | T         | Thumb/ARM mode  |
| 4:0     | M         | Mode bits       |

These flags are responsible for the outcome of some operations and impact the control flow of a program.
