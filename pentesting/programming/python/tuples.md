  A tuple is very similar to a list, but it is immutable. This means that once
  the values in a tuple have been set, they cannot be changed. We declare a
  tuple with parentheses.

# Tuples

Declaring a Tuple

```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)

type(tup1)
<class 'tuple'>

print(tup1)
(1, 2, 3)
```

Complex Tuples

```python
tup2 = (1,2, ['alfa', 'bravo'], b'ABCDEF')

type(tup2[0])
<class 'int'>

type(tup2[2])
<class 'list'>

type(tup2[3])
<class 'bytes'>

type(tup2[2][1])
<class 'str'>
```
