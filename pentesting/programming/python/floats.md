# Floats

Working with Float variables

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
a = 54
print(a)
print(type(a))
a = a + .5
print(a)
print(type(a))
```

Setting a Floating Point Value

```python
fnum1 = 12.75
type(fnum1)
<class 'float'>

fnum2=67.
type(fnum2)
<class 'float'>
```

More float declarations

```python
fnum3 = fnum2 / fnum1
print(fnum3)
5.254901960784314

type(fnum3)
<class 'float'>

fnum4 = fnum2 / fnum1
print(fnum4)
5.0

type(fnum4)
<class 'float'>

fnum5 = fnum2 % fnum1
print(fnum5)
3.25
```

A Floating Anomaly

```python
fnum1 = 0.1
fnum2 = 0.2 
fnum3 = fnum1 + fnum2 
print(fnum3)
0.30000000000000004

fnum3==0.3
False
```

Rounding Floats

```python
round(fnum3,1)
0.3
```

Converting Between Floats and Integers

```python
inum1 = 164
inum2 = 37
fnum1 = inum1 / inum2
print(fnum1)
4.4324324324324325

type(fnum1)
<class 'float'>

inum3 = int(fnum1)
print(inum3)
4

type(inum3)
<class 'int'>

fnum2 = float(inum3)
print(fnum2)
4.0
```

Very Small Floating Points

```python
fnum1 = 0.002
print(type(fnum1),fnum1)
<class 'float'> 0.002

fnum2 = 0.000002
print(type(fnum2),fnum2)
<class 'float'> 2e-06

astring = str(fnum2)
print(astring)
2e-06
```

Rounded Floats

```python
fnum3 = 1.4966517743e17

print("%.3g"%fnum3)
1.49e17
```
