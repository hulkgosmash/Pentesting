# Modify Existing GPO

Modifying an existing GPO that is already applied to one or more OUs is the most straightforward scenario.  To search for these, we need to enumerate all GPOs in the domain with `Get-DomainGPO` and check the ACL of each one with `Get-DomainObjectAcl`.  We want to filter any for which a principal has modify privileges such as CreateChild, WriteProperty or GenericWrite, and also want to filter out the legitimate principals including SYSTEM, Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins.
