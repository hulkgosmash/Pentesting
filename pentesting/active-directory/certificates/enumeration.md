# Enumeration

## Finding Certificate Authorities

To find AD CS Certificate Authorities (CA's) in a domain or forest, run [Certify](https://github.com/GhostPack/Certify) with the cas parameter.

```powershell
# Native
Certify.exe cas
# Cobalt Strike
execute-assembly C:\Tools\Certify\Certify\bin\Release\Certify.exe cas
```

## Misconfigured Certificate Templates

AD CS certificate templates are provided by Microsoft as a starting point for distributing certificates.  They are designed to be duplicated and configured for specific needs.  Misconfigurations within these templates can be abused for privilege escalation.

Certify can also find vulnerable templates.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
# Native
Certify.exe find /vulnerable
# Cobalt Strike
execute-assembly C:\Tools\Certify\Certify\bin\Release\Certify.exe find /vulnerable
```
{% endcode %}

Let's go through the key parts of this output.

1. This template is served by _sub-ca_.
2. The template is called _CustomUser_.
3. _ENROLLEE\_SUPPLIES\_SUBJECT_ is enabled, which allows the certificate requestor to provide any SAN (subject alternative name).
4. The certificate usage has _Client Authentication_ set.
5. _DEV\Domain Users_ have enrollment rights, so any domain user may request a certificate from this template.

**If a principal you control has WriteOwner, WriteDacl or WriteProperty, then this could also be abused.**

This configuration allows any domain user to request a certificate for any other domain user (including a domain admin) and use it for authentication. Request a certificate for nlamb.
