# Kerberos Delegation

Microsoft's Kerberos delegation solves this design issue and provides a way for the web server to authenticate to the backend database on behalf of the user. Microsoft released several implementations of this including _unconstrained delegation_ (in 2000), _constrained delegation_ (in 2003), and _resource based constrained delegation_ (in 2012)
