# iwconfig and Other Utilities

Let's take a moment to discuss some of the deprecated utilities available in Linux.

* _iwconfig_ manipulates the basic wireless parameters: change modes, set channels, and keys.
* _iwlist_ allows for the initiation of scanning, listing frequencies, bit rates, and encryption keys.
* _iwspy_ provides per-node link quality (not often implemented by drivers).
* _iwpriv_ allows for the manipulation of the Wireless Extensions specific to a driver.

To see the channel numbers and corresponding frequencies that our wireless interface is able to detect, we can run iwlist with the interface name followed by the frequency parameter:

```bash
sudo iwlist wlan0 frequency
```

Note that the command output will vary based on geography.
