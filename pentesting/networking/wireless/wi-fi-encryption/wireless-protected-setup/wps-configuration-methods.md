# WPS Configuration Methods

A device supporting Wi-Fi Simple Configuration should always have a default PIN available (aka device password), printed on the AP or on a label affixed to it. However, it is recommended that the PIN be changeable by the end-user.

Two modes of operations are available: in-band configuration and out-of-band configuration. In-band is done via WLAN communication and out-of-band is done using any other communication channel or method, such as by using a NFC tag or USB thumbdrive.

Out-of-band can be unencrypted and has the advantage that it can be reused with multiple enrolees but if an attacker gets their hands on the media, they have the WLAN credentials. Out-of-band methods can also hold encrypted WLAN credentials. It uses the enrolee public key obtained over the WLAN channel. One last possibility is to do a Diffie-Hellman key exchange over NFC, then encrypt the credentials delivered to the NFC interface using AES.

In in-band, a Diffie-Hellman key exchange is done and authenticated using a shared secret (the device password) via manual entry or using NFC. In most cases, using a headless device, the PIN has to be 8-digit long (where the last digit is a checksum). If the device has a display, the PIN can be either 8 or 4 digits long but in this case, it has to be randomly generated.
