# WPS Architecture

WPS defines three components:

* Enrolee: a device seeking to join a WLAN
* Access point
* Registrar: an entity with the authority to issue or revoke credentials for a WLAN

There are three interfaces:

* **E:** logically located between the Enrolee and the Registrar. The purpose is for the Registrar to issue credentials to an Enrolee
* **M:** the interface between the Registrar and the Access Point. It manages and configures the access point
* **A:** enables the discovery of WPS access points (via IE in beacons) and for external registrars, enables communications between the enrolees and the registrars
*

    Although the Registrar often runs on the access point (known as "standalone AP" or "internal registrar"), the Registrar and AP can be distinct systems, such as a mobile device used to configure the Enrolee. The Registrar can also be located on a centralized management interface.

    Even though WPS is thought to be WPA-PSK only, it can technically also be used in some cases for WPA Enterprise. In the case of a WPA-PSK network, it is possible to have one client become a registrar and configure new clients.
