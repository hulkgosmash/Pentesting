# Connection

PMF status is indicated in the beacon, in the RSN IE, and two bits show the settings, in the RSN capabilities.

First one, bit 6, is about PMF requirement. If set, if the client doesn't support PMF (either capable or required), it won't be able to connect.

Bit 7 indicates if the AP is PMF capable. It is automatically set when bit 6 is set. In this case, an AP will accept clients with and without PMF. Those with (capable or required), will benefit from the added protection while still allowing clients that cannot handle it as well.

When connecting, the client will have a RSN IE in its association request with its own settings for PMF.

The following table details the outcome of connection depending on the client and AP settings' for PMF:

| AP       | Client   | Connection | PMF |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- | --- |
| No       | No       | Yes        | No  |
| No       | Capable  | Yes        | No  |
| No       | Required | No         |     |
| Capable  | No       | Yes        | No  |
| Capable  | Capable  | Yes        | Yes |
| Capable  | Required | Yes        | Yes |
| Required | No       | No         |     |
| Required | Capable  | Yes        | Yes |
| Required | Required | Yes        | Yes |

In case a client or AP has invalid settings, no connection should occur. When a station does and tries to associate to an AP, association will be rejected.
