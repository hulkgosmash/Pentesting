**Layer 7**: At the very top of the model, the _Application Layer_ defines how a human or software can interact with a network. It's important to note that the word _application_ in this context does **not** refer to programs or applications themselves, but rather refers to how the software receives data. For example, browsing the web and downloading emails are some of the types of activity facilitated by the Application Layer. Information transmitted via the Application Layer is simply referred to as _data_.

**Layer 6**: The _Presentation Layer_ is responsible for taking the data it receives from the layer below it, and for rearranging it so the Application Layer can present to a user. Encrypting, compressing, or otherwise transforming data are examples of activities that happen on the Presentation Layer. As with the Application Layer, we refer to information transfer on Layer 6 as _data_.

**Layer 5**: The _Session Layer_ implements protocols that initiate, maintain, and eventually terminate multiple different connections between computers. These ongoing connections are often called _sessions_. As the lowest of the data layers, we continue to refer to information on this layer as _data_.

**Layer 4**: The _Transport Layer_ is largely (but not solely) responsible for making sure that data gets from Host A to Host B in proper order and on time. It handles errors, makes sure that hosts involved in the communication are aware if any data needs to be resent, and alerts the sending host(s) if they are sending information across the network too quickly for the receiver(s) to handle. The Transport Layer has multiple PDUs, depending on if the protocol involved maintains a connection between participants, or if it merely allows one-off broadcasting[2](https://portal.offensive-security.com/courses/soc-100/books-and-videos/modal/modules/networking-fundamentals/the-osi-model/osi-model-details#fn2).

For connection-oriented (or _stateful_) protocols, we refer to information units as _segments_, because protocols at this layer will define ways for breaking down longer messages into smaller ones via a process called _segmentation_. For connection-less (or _stateless_) protocols, we call information units _datagrams_, which is an amalgamation of the words "data" and "telegram".

**Layer 3**: The _Network Layer_, true to its namesake, is primarily concerned with information traveling between two or more _different_ networks. Some of its functions are the routing and broadcasting of messages, and the addressing of multiple hosts. We're already familiar with its PDU: information at this layer are called _packets_.

**Layer 2**: The _Data Link layer_ is tasked with transferring information between hosts that are physically connected on the same network. Protocols operating on Layer 2 define rules for initiating, monitoring, and terminating communication between physically connected machines. It performs error detection and correction for issues that occur on the layer below it. Unlike the layers above it, OSI defines two sub-layers within the Data Link Layer. _Media Access Control_ (MAC) determines how and when different devices are allowed to communicate to each other, whereas _Logical Link Control_ (LLC) provides flow control and error handling functions on Layer 2. The Data Link Layer's PDU is called a _frame_.

**Layer 1**: Finally, the _Physical Layer_ transfers raw data between a physical machine and a physical transmission medium (like a wire). From a security perspective, we're often (though of course, not always) less interested in this layer, because it deals with the underlying physics of data transfer. It's responsible for the transformation of _digital_ bits into various kinds of _physical_ bits, like electricity, radio waves, and photons. It deals with electrical engineering topics like cable specifications, voltage calculations, and radio frequencies. The PDU at the Physical Layer can be referred to as _symbols_ or just _bits_.
