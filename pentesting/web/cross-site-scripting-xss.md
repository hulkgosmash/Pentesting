# Cross-site scripting (XSS)

## Types

* **Reflected XSS**, where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
* **Stored XSS**, where the malicious script comes from the website's database.
* **DOM-based XSS**, where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.
