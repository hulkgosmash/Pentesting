# PHP

```
eval () is a PHP function that allows to interpret a given string as PHP code, because eval () is often used in Web applications,
although interpretation of the chain is widely liked manipulated, eval () serves most of the time to execute php code containing previously defined variable.
the problem is that if eval () executes a variable that you can modify the code contained by php eval () will execute as such.
Reminder: eval () allows execution of a given string as PHP code but not write (or if so desired) its content in this page or others, he is content to perform, and display the result.
We will even two different PHP source code using Eval (), the possibilities of PHP code injection and how how to use eval () can change the syntax of PHP code to execute.
