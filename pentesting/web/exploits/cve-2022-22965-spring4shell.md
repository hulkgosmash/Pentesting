# CVE-2022-22965 Spring4Shell

## **Overview**

Spring4Shell was originally released as an 0-day in a now-deleted thread of Tweets. It was quickly identified as a bypass of the patch for [CVE-2010-1622](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1622) — a vulnerability in earlier versions of the Spring Framework which allowed attackers to obtain remote command execution by abusing the way in which Spring handles data sent in HTTP requests. In short, the vulnerability allows attackers to upload a "webshell" (a piece of code which accepts commands from the attacker that the webserver is then tricked into executing) to the vulnerable server, achieving remote command execution.

## **How Does it Work?**

To understand Spring4Shell, it is important that we understand CVE-2010-1622. Spring MVC (**M**odel-**V**iew-**C**ontroller) is part of the Spring Framework which makes it easy to develop web applications following the MVC design pattern. One of the features of Spring MVC is that it automatically instantiates and populates an object of a specified class when a request is made based on the parameters sent to the endpoint. In simple terms, this could be abused to overwrite important attributes of the parent class, resulting in remote code execution.

Spring4Shell works along similar lines, bypassing the mitigations that were added to patch CVE-2010-1622. The majority of the exploits for the Spring4Shell vulnerability operate by forcing the application to write a malicious `.jsp` file (effectively plaintext Java which Tomcat can execute — much like a PHP webserver would execute files with a `.php` extension) to the webserver. This webshell can then be executed to gain remote command execution over the target.

## **Limitations**

Fortunately, despite how commonly used the Spring Framework is, the conditions in which the vulnerability can be exploited are actually fairly limited.\


The Spring4Shell vulnerability affects Spring Core before version 5.2, as well as in versions 5.3.0-17 and 5.2.0-19, running on a version of the **J**ava **D**evelopment **K**it (JDK) greater than or equal to 9. The publicly available exploits currently available only work on applications deployed to Apache Tomcat as WARs; however, the Spring Framework maintainers have stated that they believe there may be other ways to exploit the vulnerability.

Current conditions for vulnerability (as stated in [Spring's announcement of the vulnerability](https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-framework-rce-early-announcement)) can be summarised as follows:

* JDK 9+
* A vulnerable version of the Spring Framework (<5.2 | 5.2.0-19 | 5.3.0-17)\

* Apache Tomcat as a server for the Spring application, packaged as a WAR
* A dependency on the `spring-webmvc` and/or `spring-webflux` components of the Spring Framework\


It is worth noting, however, that these may change over time as other ways to exploit the vulnerability are discovered.

## **Remediations**

Fortunately, patched versions of the Spring Framework have been released. To remediate Spring4Shell, ensure that you are using a version of Spring released after patch 18 of minor release 5.3 (i.e. after 5.3.18), or after patch 20 if using minor release 5.2 (i.e. after 5.2.20). Upgrading the version of the framework is enough to remove the vulnerability from your applications.

If upgrading is not possible, it is possible to somewhat mitigate this vulnerability by setting a blocklist of vulnerable field patterns. More advice on this can be found [here](https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-framework-rce-early-announcement).
