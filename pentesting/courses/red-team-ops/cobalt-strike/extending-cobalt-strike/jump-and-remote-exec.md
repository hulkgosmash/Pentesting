# Jump & Remote-Exec

Aggressor can be used to register new techniques under `jump` and `remote-exec` using [beacon\_remote\_exploit\_register](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics\_aggressor-scripts/as-resources\_functions.htm#beacon\_remote\_exploit\_register) and [beacon\_remote\_exec\_method\_register](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics\_aggressor-scripts/as-resources\_functions.htm#beacon\_remote\_exec\_method\_register) respectively.

In this example, we'll integrate `Invoke-DCOM.ps1` into `jump`.  First, create a new text file in Visual Studio and save is somewhere as `dcom.cna`.  Then add the following skeleton.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```csharp
sub invoke_dcom
{
}

beacon_remote_exploit_register("dcom", "x64", "Use DCOM to run a Beacon payload", &invoke_dcom);
```
{% endcode %}

This will register "dcom" as a new option inside the jump command and specifies `invoke_dcom` as the associated callback function.  The first thing to add inside this callback are some local variable declarations.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```csharp
sub invoke_dcom
{
    local('$handle $script $oneliner $payload');
}

beacon_remote_exploit_register("dcom", "x64", "Use DCOM to run a Beacon payload", &invoke_dcom);
```
{% endcode %}

`local` defines variables that are local to the current function, so they will disappear once executed.  Sleep can have `global`, `closure-specific` and `local` scopes.  More information can be found in **5.2 Scalar Scope** of the Sleep manual.

The next step is to acknowledge receipt of the task using [btask](https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#btask).  This takes the ID of the Beacon, the text to post and an ATT\&CK tactic ID.  This will print a message to the Beacon console and add it to the data model used in the activity and session reports that you can generate from Cobalt Strike.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```csharp
sub invoke_dcom
{
    local('$handle $script $oneliner $payload');

    # acknowledge this command
    btask($1, "Tasked Beacon to run " . listener_describe($3) . " on $2 via DCOM", "T1021");
}
```
{% endcode %}

You'll notice `$1`, `$2` and `$3` variables here which are automatically passed in by the client.  Where:

* $1 is the Beacon ID.
* $2 is the target to jump to.
* $3 is the selected listener.



Furthermore, [listener\_describe](https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#listener\_describe) expands a listener name into a more detailed description.  For example, instead of "smb" it will say "windows/beacon\_bind\_pipe (\\\\.\pipe\\\<pipename>)".

Next, we want to read in the Invoke-DCOM script from our machine.  This can be done [openf](http://sleep.dashnine.org/manual/openf.html), [getFileProper](http://sleep.dashnine.org/manual/getFileProper.html) and [script\_resource](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics\_aggressor-scripts/as-resources\_functions.htm#script\_resource).  Notice how we're assigning values to the variables we declared at the start.
