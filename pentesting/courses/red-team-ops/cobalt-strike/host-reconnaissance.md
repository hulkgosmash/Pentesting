# Host Reconnaissance

## Processes

List running processes on a system

```bash
ps
```

## Seatbelt

Check for security configurations such as OS info, AV, AppLocker, LAPS, PowerShell logging, audit policies, .NET versions, firewall rules, and more.

```bash
execute-assembly C:\Tools\Seatbelt\Seatbelt\bin\Release\Seatbelt.exe -group=system
```

## Screenshots

Beacon has multiple commands for taking screenshots which work in slightly different ways.

```bash
# Take a single screenshot via PrintScr method
printscreen
# Take a single screenshot
screenshot
# Take periodic screenshots of desktop
screenwatch
```

To see all the screenshots that have been taken, go to **View > Screenshots**.

## Keylogger

Capture the keystrokes of a user

```bash
keylogger
```

All keystrokes can be seen at **View > Keystrokes**.

## Clipboard

The `clipboard` command will capture any text from the user's clipboard (it does not capture images or any other types of data).  This can be handy for capturing credentials that are being copy/pasted, which can be especially prevalent when password managers are in use.

This is a one-off command (it does not run as a job) and dumps the content directly to the Beacon console.

```bash
clipboard
```

## User Sessions

Users that are currently logged on to this same machine may be good targets to attack.  If they are more privileged then our current user in the domain, they may be a good candidate for lateral movement to other machines. &#x20;

The `net logons` command will list the logon sessions on this machine.

```bash
net logons
```
