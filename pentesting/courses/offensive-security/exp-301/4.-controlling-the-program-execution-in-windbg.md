# 4. Controlling the Program Execution in WinDbg

### Software Breakpoints

When placing a software breakpoint, WinDbg temporarily replaces the first opcode of the instruction where we want execution to halt with an INT 3 assembly instruction. The advantage of software breakpoints is that we are allowed to set as many as we want.

```bash
# Set a breakpoint at the Windows WriteFile API
bp kernel32!WriteFile
# List all break points
bl
# Let execution continue
g
# Disable breakpoint 0
bd 0
# Enable breakpoint 0
be 0
# Clear breakpoint 0
bc 0

```
