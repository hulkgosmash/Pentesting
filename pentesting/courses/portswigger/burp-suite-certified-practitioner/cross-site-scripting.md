# Cross-site scripting

In this section, we'll explain what cross-site scripting is, describe the different varieties of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and spell out how to find and prevent cross-site scripting.&#x20;

## What is XSS? <a href="#what-is-cross-site-scripting-xss" id="what-is-cross-site-scripting-xss"></a>

Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to acdess any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.&#x20;

## How does XSS work?

Cross-site scripting works by mnipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users. When the malicious code executes inside a victim's browser, the attacker can fully compromise their interaction with the application.&#x20;

## Proof of concept

You can confirm most kinds of XSS vulnerability by injecting a payload that causes your own browser to execute some arbitrary JavaScript. It's long been common practice to use the `alert()` function for this purpose because it's short, harmless, and pretty hard to miss when it's successfully called. In fact, you solve the majority of our XSS labs by invoking `alert()` in a simulated victim's browser.&#x20;

Unfortunately, there's a slight hitch if you use Chrome. From version 92 onward (July 20th, 2021), cross-origin iframes are prevented from calling `alert()`. As these are used to construct some of the more advanced XSS attacks, you'll sometimes need to use an alternative PoC payload. In this sscenario, we recomment the `print()` function. If you're interested in learning more about this change and why we like `print()`, check out our blog post on the subject.&#x20;

As the simulated victim in our labs uses Chrome, we've amended the affected labs so that they can also be solved using `print()`. We've indicated this in the instruction wherever relevant.&#x20;

## Types of XSS attacks?

There are three main types of XSS attacks. These are:

* **Reflected XSS**, where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.&#x20;
* **Stored XSS**, where the malicious script comes from the website's database.&#x20;
* **DOM-based XSS**, where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.&#x20;

## Reflected cross-site scripting

**Reflected XSS** is the simplest variety of cross-site scripting. It arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and included that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way.&#x20;

Here is a simple example of a reflected XSS vulnerability:

```html
https://insecure-website.com/status?message=All+is+well.
<p>Status: All is well.</p>
```

The application doesn't perform any other processing of the data, so an attacker can easily construct an attack like this:&#x20;

```html
https://insecure-website.com/status?message=<script>/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/</script>
<p>Status: <script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>
```

If the user visits the URL constructed by the attacker, then the attacker's script executes in the user's browser, in the context of that user's session with the application. At that point, the script can carry out any action, and retrieve any data, to which the user has access.&#x20;
