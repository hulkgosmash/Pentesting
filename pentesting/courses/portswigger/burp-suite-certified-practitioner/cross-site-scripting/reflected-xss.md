# Reflected XSS

In this section, we'll explain reflected cross-site scripting, describe the impact of reflected XSS attacks, and spell out how to find reflected XSS vulnerabilities.&#x20;

## What is reflected cross-site scripting? <a href="#what-is-reflected-cross-site-scripting" id="what-is-reflected-cross-site-scripting"></a>

Reflected cross-site scripting (or XSS) arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way.&#x20;

Suppose a website has a search function which receives the user-supplied search term in a URL parameter:&#x20;

```html
https://insecure-website.com/search?term=gift
```

The application echoes the supplied search term in  the response to this URL:&#x20;

```html
<p>You searched for: gift</p>
```

Assuming the application doesn't perform any other processing of the data, an attacker can construct an attack like this:&#x20;

```html
https://insecure-website.com/search?term=<script>/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/</script>
```

This URL results in the following response:&#x20;

```html
<p>You searched for: <script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>
```

If another user of the application requests the attacker's URL, then the script supplied by the attacker will execute in the victim user's browser, in the context of their session with the application.&#x20;

## Impact of reflected XSS attacks

If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things, the attacker can:&#x20;

* Perform any action within the application that the user can perform.&#x20;
* View any information that the user is able to view.&#x20;
* Modify any information that the user is able to modify.&#x20;
* Initiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user.&#x20;

There are various means by which an attacker might induce a victim user to make a request that they control, to deliver a reflected XSS attack. These include placing links on a website controlled by the attacker, or on another website that allows content to be generated, or by sending a link in an email, tweet or other message. The attack could be targeted directly against a known user, or could be an indiscriminate attack against any users of the application.&#x20;

The need for an external delivery mechanism for the attack means that the impact of reflected XSS is generally less severe that stored XSS, where a self-contained attack can be delivered within the vulnerable application itself.&#x20;

## Reflected XSS in different contexts

There are many different varieties of reflected cross-site scripting. The location of the reflected data within the application's response determines what type of payload is required to exploit it and might also affect the impact of the vulnerability.&#x20;

In addition, if the application performs any validation or other processing on the submitted data before it is reflected, this will generally affect what kind of XSS payload is needed.&#x20;

## How to find and test for reflected XSS vulnerabilities <a href="#how-to-find-and-test-for-reflected-xss-vulnerabilities" id="how-to-find-and-test-for-reflected-xss-vulnerabilities"></a>

The vast majority of flrected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be found quickly and reliably using Burp Suite's web vulnerablity scanner.&#x20;

Testing for reflected XSS vulnerablities manually involves the following steps:&#x20;

* Test every entry point. Test separately every entry point for data within the application's HTTP requests. This includes parameters or other data within the URL query string and message body, and the URL file path. It also includes HTTP headers, although XSS-like behaviour that can only be triggered via certain HTTP headers may not be exploitable in practice.&#x20;
