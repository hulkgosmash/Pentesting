# NTFS Permissions

**Read**: Allows the user to view the contents of the file. Crucially, _read_ also allows users to execute scripts.

**Write**: Allows the user to write to the file. Note that _write_ does not allow a user to delete the file, though they can delete its contents.

**Read & Execute**: Allows the user to read the file, as well as execute binaries.

**Modify**: Allows the user to read and write to the file. Also allows the user to delete it.

**Full Control**: Allows the user to read, write, change, or delete the file.

Here is the basic set of permissions assignable to _directories_.

**Read**: Allows the user to view and list any file in the directory.

**Write**: Allows the user to add files or subfolders to the directory.

**Read & Execute**: Allows the user to view and list any file or subfolder in the directory, and also allows execution of any binary within the folder.

**List Folder Contents**: Allows the user to list any file or subfolder in the directory and also allows execution of any binary within the folder. _List Folder Contents_ appears at first glance very similar to Read & Execute. The difference between them is that Read & Execute allows for viewing the contents of files as well.

**Modify**: Allows the user to read, write and delete files and subfolders within the directory.

**Full Control**: Allows the user to read, write, change, and delete files and subfolders within the directory. Note that the _Full Control_ permission on a directory allows the user to delete all files in it, even if they aren't assigned Modify or Full Control permissions on the files themselves.

View permissions on the temp directory

```powershell
icacls C:\Temp
```

Using icacls to grant permissions

```powershell
icacls C:\Temp /grant user:(OI)(CI)(F)
```

View permissions (**/T** executes the operation recursively on all subfolders, **/C** forces the operation to continue despite any errors)

```powershell
icacls Music /t /c
```

Using accesschk to view permissions

```powershell
accesschk.exe "users" c:\
```
