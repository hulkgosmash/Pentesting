* **Runlevel 0**: The system state when it is halted or powered off. This is not an effective runlevel, but it can be called on to execute a system shutdown.
* **Runlevel 1** (**Single User Mode**): The state where only one user (root) can log in to the system to conduct administrative tasks. Networking is disabled for this runlevel and only the command-line interface is used.
* **Runlevel 2** (**Multiuser Mode**): The network is disabled and the command-line interface is used.
* **Runlevel 3** (**Multiuser Mode with Networking**): The command-line interface is used and networking is enabled.
* **Runlevel 4**: Undefined by default. This is available for a custom runlevel, if required.
* **Runlevel 5** (**Multiuser Mode with a Graphical User Interface**): Networking is enabled. This is the default runlevel\_on any Linux distribution that is using a GUI.
* **Runlevel 6**: The runlevel to restart the Linux host. This is another runlevel that is not effective, but it can be called on to execute a system restart.
