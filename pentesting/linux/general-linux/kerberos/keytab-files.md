# Keytab Files

One way to allow automated scripts to access Kerberos-enabled network resources on a user's behalf is through the use of _keytab_ files. Keytab files contain a Kerberos principal name and encrypted keys. These allow a user or script to authenticate to Kerberos resources elsewhere on the network on the principal's behalf without entering a password.

## Creating a keytab file

```bash
# Creating a keytab file
ktutil
addent -password -p administrator@CORP1.COM -k 1 -e rc4-hmac
wkt /tmp/administrator.keytab
quit
# This will write the keytab file to /tmp/administrator.keytab
```
