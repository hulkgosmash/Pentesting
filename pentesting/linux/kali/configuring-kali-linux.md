# Configuring Kali Linux

## Managing Users and Groups

### Modifying Accounts & Passwords

* `passwd`—permits a regular user to change their password, which in turn, updates the `/etc/shadow` file.
* `chfn`—(CHange Full Name), reserved for the super-user (root), modifies the `GECOS`, or "general information" field.
* `chsh`—(CHange SHell) changes the user's login shell. However, available choices will be limited to those listed in `/etc/shells`; the administrator, on the other hand, is not bound by this restriction and can set the shell to any program chosen.
* `chage`—(CHange AGE) allows the administrator to change the password expiration settings by passing the user name as an argument or list current settings using the `-l user` option. Alternatively, you can also force the expiration of a password using the `passwd -e user` command, which forces the user to change their password the next time they log in.

### Disabling an Account

```bash
# Lock a user account
passwd -l user
# Unlock a user account
passwd -u user
```

### Managing Groups

```bash
# Add a group
addgroup group
# Delete a group
delgroup group
# Change password for a group
gpasswd group
# Delete password for a group
gpasswd -r group
# Start a new shell as a group
newgrp
# Run a command as a group
sg
# Show users groups
id
```

## Services

### Configuring a Specific Program

```bash
# List all of the files included in a package
dpkg -L package
# Display the package metadata
dpkg -s package
```

### Configuring SSH for remote logins

```bash
# Manually start the SSH service
systemctl start ssh
# Configure SSH service to start at boot time
systemctl enable ssh
# Modify the configuration
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# To apply modified configuration
systemctl reload ssh
# Host keys are located here
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
# Reload host keys
passwd
[...]
rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
systemct restart ssh
```
