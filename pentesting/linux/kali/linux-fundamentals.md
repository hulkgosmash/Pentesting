## Hardware

The kernel exports data about detected hardware through the `/proc/` and `/sys/` virtual file systems. Applications often access devices by way of files created within `/dev/`. Specific files represent disk drives (for instance, `/dev/sda`), partitions (`/dev/sda1`), mice (`/dev/input/mouse0`), keyboards (`/dev/input/event0`), sound cards (`/dev/snd/*`), serial ports (`/dev/ttyS*`), and other components.

There are two types of device files: _block_ and _character_. The former has characteristics of a block of data: It has a finite size, and you can access bytes at any position in the block. The latter behaves like a flow of characters. You can read and write characters, but you cannot seek to a given position and change arbitrary bytes. To find out the type of a given device file, inspect the first letter in the output of `ls -l`. It is either `b`, for block devices, or `c`, for character devices:
