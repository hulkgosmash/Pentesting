wget -q -O - https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc | gpg --import
# or
gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key
# verify the signature
wget https://cdimage.kali.org/current/SHA256SUMS
wget https://cdimage.kali.org/current/SHA256SUMS.gpg
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.gpg SHA256SUMS
# Verify that the downloaded file has the same checksum that is listed in SHA256SUMS
grep kali-linux-2020.3-live-amd64.iso SHA256SUMS | sha256sum -c

## Create Boot Media

### **On Windows**

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# Download and install
https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/
# Launch Win32 Disk Imager and choose the Kali Linux ISO file that you want to copy on the USB key. Verify that the letter of the device selected corresponds with that assigned to the USB key. Once you are certain that you have selected the correct drive, click the Write button and confirm that you want to overwrite the contents of the USB key

sudo su
# Plug in USB drive then run dmesg to find which disk it is e.g. /dev/sdb
dmesg
# Write ISO to the disk
dd if=kali-linux-2020.3-live-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdb
```

### **On OS X/macOS**

```bash
# Identify the device name of the USB key
diskutil list
# Unmount the disk
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
# Write the image to disk
dd if=kali-linux-2020.3-live-amd64.iso of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=4m
```

## Boot from media on PC
