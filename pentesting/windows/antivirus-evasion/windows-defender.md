## Disable Defender Permanently

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
1. go to safeboot
2. disable service same as in guide above
3. reboot system, keep safeboot enabled for now
4. as soon as it starts (gotta go fast before defender service can re-enable itself) go to folder C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\
5. rename folders “Windows Defender” and “Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection”, add “old” at the end or something
6. create new empty folders “Windows Defender” and “Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection”
7. right click new empty “Windows Defender” folder, go to Properties, Permissions, Advanced, Take Ownership of folder, (set to your windows user name), close all opened folder property windows (has to be done for some reason), then go back to Advanced Permissions
8. Disable Inheritance button to remove all existing permissions
9. Add new permission for “SYSTEM”, set to Deny, check all checkmarks (including hidden advanced ones)
10. Add second permission for “Everyone” just in case, deny everything
11. repeat points 6 to 9 for second folder “Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection”
12. done. defender folders now are empty and locked, can’t be accessed or restored even by system
13. reboot system back to normal mode, defender is gone for good. everything seem to be working fine, no errors, no problems etc
```
