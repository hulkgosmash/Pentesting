# Getting Started with Git

In this Topic, we will cover the following Learning Units:

* Why Git? Exploring Git history and features
* Git good: working with local and remote repositories

Imagine being part of a team of developers working on a coding project. To keep in sync, each contributor has to email their code to the other contributors at the end of each work day. The lead developer takes everyone's contributions, updates the main code, and then sends the latest update back to each contributor, so they can continue coding the next day. To say the least, this method of collaboration is extremely inefficient but not too far from reality when we examine history.

Enter _Git_, a _distributed version control_ software that is used by thousands of companies, developers, and other software platforms. We can use Git to collaborate on projects in a very efficient manner.

If you're unfamiliar with version control, it's software that allows for easy tracking and management of changes to documents. It's commonly used in software development but is also finding its way into other areas where tracking updates, comments, and fostering collaboration are useful. Version control is used in fields beyond software development including education, science, documentation, and many others.

In this Topic, we will explore Git's background and its impact on the computing world. We will walk through numerous commands and exercises, increasing our proficiency with Git. This Topic is best followed by Git Branching and Merging, as some aspects covered here will be expanded upon in that Topic.
