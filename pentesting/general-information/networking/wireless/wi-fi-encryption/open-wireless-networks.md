# Open Wireless Networks

Open networks do not involve any encryption so anyone running a wireless sniffer can see the traffic "as is". Public hotspots and older mesh networks are good examples of open networks. The process of connecting to an open network is shown in 1 below.

This process of connecting to the network is as follows:

1. The client sends an authentication request to the AP
2. The AP sends an authentication response of "successful"
3. The STA sends an association request to the access point
4. The AP sends an association response if the capability of the clients meets that of the AP
