# Wi-Fi Protected Access

The IEEE 802.11i group, aimed at improving wireless security, proceeded to develop two new link layer encryption protocols: Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) and Counter Mode with CBC-MAC (CCMP).

CCMP was designed from the ground up and took much more time to complete in comparison to TKIP. TKIP ended up with the commercial name _WPA1_ while _WPA2_ was given to CCMP.

WPA encryption comes in two flavors:

* **WPA Personal**: Makes use of pre-shared key authentication (WPA-PSK), a passphrase shared by all peers of the network.
* **WPA Enterprise**: Uses 802.1X and a Radius server for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA).

In Figure 5 below, we have an illustration of the setup to create the WPA secure communication channel.
