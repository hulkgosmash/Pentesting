# WPA Ciphers

Two ciphers are available, TKIP, for legacy hardware that can only handle WEP, and CCMP, that is based on Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

**TKIP**

TKIP is based on the third draft of 802.11i. It was designed to be backward compatible with legacy hardware and still uses WEP as the encryption algorithm although it addresses the flaws found in WEP with the following elements:

* Per packet key mixing
* IV sequencing to avoid replay attacks
* New Message Integrity Check (MIC), using the Michael algorithm and countermeasures on MIC failures
* Key distribution and rekeying mechanism

**CCMP**

CCMP is the implementation of the final version of 802.11i and is also called Robust Security Network (RSN). It makes use of a new AES-based algorithm. It was designed from the ground up and is not compatible with older hardware.
