# WPA Network Connection

The secure communication channel is set up in four steps:

1. Agreement on security protocols
2. Authentication
3. Key distribution and verification
4. Data encryption and integrity

In Figure 6 below, we have an illustration of the setup to create the WPA Enteprise secure communication channel.

In WPA-PSK systems, the process is slightly simplified, as only 3 steps are required. The authentication step is removed as illustrated below.

**Agreement on Security Protocols**

The different security protocols allowed by the AP are provided in its beacons:

* Authentication means, either by PSK or by 802.1X using a AAA server
* Unicast and multicast/broadcast traffic encryption suite: TKIP, CCMP

The STA first sends a probe request in order to receive network information (i.e. rates, encryption, channel, etc.) and will join the network by using open authentication followed by association where it indicates which ciphers will be used.
