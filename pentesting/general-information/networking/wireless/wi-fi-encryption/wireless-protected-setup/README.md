# Wireless Protected Setup

Also known as Wi-Fi Simple Configuration, this protocol allows users to pair devices to a network without having to enter the ESSID and/or its (sometimes complex) passphrase.

In the past, different vendors provided various solutions to this problem but they were incompatible between each other. The Wi-Fi alliance launched WPS in 2006 with the aim of standardizing the solutions.

WPS currently supports Open or WPA2 networks (with CCMP or GCMP) as well as WPA2 Enterprise networks. WPA (TKIP) has been deprecated in the current version of the specification.

Enrolment can be done in various ways such as using a push button on the access point, entering a PIN from a label, via a display on the Access Point, from its web interface (static or dynamic PIN), or using Near Field Communications (NFC) with tap to connect.
