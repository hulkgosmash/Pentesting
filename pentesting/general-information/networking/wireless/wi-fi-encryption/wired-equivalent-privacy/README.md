# Wired Equivalent Privacy

Open networks are susceptible to eavesdropping, as the traffic on them is not encrypted. WEP aims at providing some degree of privacy to data exchanged on the wireless network. It is part of the IEEE 802.11 standard and is a scheme used to secure wireless networks using Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) to encrypt traffic and performs CRC32 checksums for message integrity.

WEP encryption only uses a 24-bit initialization vector (IV) as when the WEP standard was being drafted, the key size was limited due to US government export restrictions on cryptographic technologies. A 64-bit key was permitted, of which, 24 bits are used for IVs, thus reducing the real key size to 40 bits. Once the export restrictions were lifted, 128-bit WEP (using the same 24-bit IV) was implemented.
