# WEP Authentication

WEP can make use of two authentication systems: Open or Shared authentication. Open authentication is trivial and commonly used. Shared authentication, on the other hand, is fairly uncommon and clients will often struggle trying open authentication before switching to shared authentication.

**Open Authentication**

In open authentication, a client does not provide any credentials when authenticating to the Access Point. However, once associated, it must possess the correct key to encrypt and decrypt data frames.

**Shared Authentication**

During authentication, a challenge text is sent to the client. The challenge text must be encrypted with the WEP key by the client and sent back to the AP for verification, which allows the client to prove knowledge of the key. Once the encrypted challenge text is received, the AP attempts to decrypt it. If it is successful and matches the clear text version of the challenge text, the client is allowed to proceed to associate to the access point.
