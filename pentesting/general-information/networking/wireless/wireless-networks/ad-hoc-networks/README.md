# Ad-Hoc Networks

An _Ad-Hoc_ network may not be something we see often, but we should be aware of them. An Ad-Hoc network, also known as an Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS), consists of at least two stations communicating without an AP.

In an Ad-Hoc network, one of the participating stations takes on some of the responsibilities of an AP, such as beaconing and authentication of new clients joining the network. The station taking on the responsibilities of the AP does not relay packets to other nodes like an AP does.

Figure 3 below shows a basic Ad-Hoc network configuration.
