# Ad-Hoc Demo

**Ad-Hoc** _Demo_ is a deviation from a standard Ad-Hoc or IBSS mode. This mode is also called _Pseudo-IBSS_ because it's a pre-standard, pre-IBSS mode with just data.

There are no management frames whatsoever (no beaconing to advertise the network, no association), and the BSSID is all zeros.

There are a number of pros and cons to Ad-Hoc Demo mode. It could be seen as a raw or bare Ad-Hoc mode. As such, we have to set the rate manually on all the wireless cards. The lack of management frames and collision avoidance mechanisms allow for a slightly higher throughput, but it requires a clear channel or strong signal.
