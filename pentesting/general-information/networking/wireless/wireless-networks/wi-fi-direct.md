# Wi-Fi Direct

Wi-Fi Direct allows direct, single-hop communications between devices and is most commonly used for printing, file sharing, and displaying pictures or videos. The connection is usually one-to-one, but devices can also form groups.

To use our running example of our small office, it may be common to have a printer connected to the Wi-Fi network. This would be considered multi-hop, since the data goes from the laptop that wants to print, to the AP, and finally on to the printer. Wi-Fi Direct, in contrast, allows the laptop to communicate directly with the printer, even if, for example, the laptop is not connected to the same infrastructure as the printer.

Wi-Fi Direct is also called Wi-Fi P2P. It is not an 802.11 standard or an amendment, but a technical specification from the Wi-Fi alliance.

Devices offering a service act as a software access point with WPS-style connections using WPA2 encryption. It must also allow service discovery. The features supported by the software access point are more or less complex depending on the services offered and may replace Bluetooth in some situations.

Some Wi-Fi Direct application examples are:

* Photo printing kiosks
* Picture frames to display photo albums
* Remote displays such as Miracast
* File sharing between devices
* Playing games
* Internet sharing (tethering)
