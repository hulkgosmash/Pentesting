# Infrastructure

Let's begin our discussion of different types and architectures of Wi-Fi networks by talking about basic infrastructure. There is at least one AP and one station (STA) in basic infrastructure networks. These two form a Basic Service Set (BSS). The AP is usually connected to a wired network, called the Distribution System (DS).

A simple example of this would be a station (STA), such as a laptop or smartphone, connected to a wireless access point (AP), which is connected by an ethernet cable to a wired router (DS). This might be the sort of setup one might find in a home or very small office.

Let's expand on this. When a set of two or more wireless APs are connected to the same wired network, we call this an Extended Service Set (ESS). Each additional AP defines a single logical network segment. See Figure 1.

To expand on our previous example of the small office network, we would take an additional network cable connected to the original access point (which has DS capabilities). We would run that cable to an area in the office that the first AP signal cannot reach. At that point, we would hook up a new wireless router. Laptops in this part of the office could use the new router as an AP, while a laptop closer to the old router would use the other AP.
