# Wireless Distribution Systems

Now that we have a basic understanding of the infrastructure, let's discuss Wireless Distribution Systems (WDS). We may recall that in infrastructure networks, APs are attached to a Distribution System (DS), a wired network. In cases where the router and AP functions are integrated, the DS would be anything other than the wireless network itself.

WDS, on the other hand, is just what it sounds like. It is a DS going over Wi-Fi instead of a cable. WDS has two connectivity modes:

* _Wireless Bridging_: Only allows WDS APs to communicate with each other.
* _Wireless Repeating_: Allows both stations and APs to communicate with each other.

The figure below shows an example of a WDS setup.

Let's consider another very basic example of a network with WDS. We'll use the example of our small office again. Let's say that the storage room in the back of the building has a computer that is too far away from the wireless router in the front of the building. Our business owner might install an additional access point near the storage room without running ethernet cable to it. The computer in the storage room communicates with the second AP, which carries the signal to the first AP in the front of the building, which is connected to the wired DS.

A WDS typically uses the same channel as the existing access point for back-haul. This channel sharing has an impact on high-traffic networks as the available data rates can be cut in half. In low-traffic networks, this likely won't be an issue.
