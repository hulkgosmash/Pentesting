# Overview

Here are some of the architectures and modes we will review along with a brief explanation of each:

* **Infrastructure** is the term we'll use to describe the organization and relationships between access points (APs) and clients. A network architecture may have a very basic infrastructure, or it may include a number of the other concepts discussed in this module.
* **Wireless Distribution System** is a way to connect multiple APs without Ethernet cables between them in order to create a single network. Different APs may have different roles in the network.
* **Ad-Hoc Networks** are a type of network in which all devices are equal. In an Ad-Hoc network, the initiating device takes care of AP duties such as beaconing and authentication.
* **Mesh Networks** are a type of network where all APs are equal, and don't have defined roles. Mesh networks are most often used to extend a network's reach in areas where running cable is difficult or impossible. There are a variety of proprietary technologies for mesh networks, but they are not compatible with each other.
* **Wi-Fi Direct** is also known as Wi-Fi Peer-to-Peer (P2P). It allows temporary connections between two or more devices to share items such as files, a display, or other services.
* **Monitor Mode** is not an architecture, per se, but a mode used by wireless cards that will help us capture Wi-Fi frames and inject packets during a penetration test.

In _all_ architectures (except in monitor mode), a Service Set Identifier (SSID) is required for network verification. In mesh, Wi-Fi P2P, and infrastructure architectures, the AP sets the SSID, whereas in Ad-Hoc mode, the station creating the network sets it.
