# Monitor Mode

Monitor mode is not a wireless mode or architecture scheme, but rather the state of a wireless device that allows it to monitor all Wi-Fi signals within its range.

Let’s imagine a scenario in which we are in a parking lot outside our penetration testing target. There are a handful of laptops connected to the target’s Wi-Fi network. If we put our Wi-Fi card in monitor mode, we’ll see much more than just ourselves, the AP, and all the other clients connected to the same AP. We will also see traffic from any other network within range, such as nearby businesses, residences, and mobile Wi-Fi hot spots.

Monitor mode is essential for wireless penetration testing as it enables the capture of raw 802.11 frames and allows packet injection. The majority of the tools used to test Wi-Fi networks require our wireless interface to be in monitor mode.
