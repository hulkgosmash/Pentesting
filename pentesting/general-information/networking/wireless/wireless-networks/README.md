# Wireless Networks

As penetration testers, it is common for us to know little or nothing about the target network when we begin. In addition, there are many different ways in which a wireless network might be designed. As our attack vectors, methods, and even the tools we use are dictated by the target network configuration and the security protocols in use, it's a good idea to have a working knowledge of the full variety of different arrangements.

For now, it is useful to think of this module as an introduction and quick reference to use when troubleshooting or encountering unfamiliar configurations of wireless networks.
