# IEEE 802.11a

The IEEE 802.11a amendment was released concurrently with 802.11b. It uses the 5GHz band, offering more channels, which do not overlap compared to those defined by 802.11b. This was also a less-crowded spectrum, unaffected by lower-cost consumer devices crowding into the 2.4GHz frequency range.

IEEE 802.11a uses Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation to provide transfer rates up to 54 Mbit/s, using 20MHz channels.

Simply put, OFDM divides each channel into multiple "subchannels", and then encodes data across multiple carrier frequencies at once. We usually refer to these subchannels as _subcarriers_, but they're also called _tones_. All subcarriers are allocated when transmitting.

There are 64 subcarriers in each channel: 48 of them carry data, 4 are pilots (synchronization tones), and 12 are null, meaning there is no transmission. Each subcarrier is 312.5 KHz wide.

As mentioned in 802.11b, each country allocates different frequencies and power levels for Wi-Fi. This is also true for 802.11a. Allocation across countries is more complex than on the 2.4GHz band, and sometimes changes over time.
