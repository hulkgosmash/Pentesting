# 802.11 Standards and Amendments

IEEE 802.11 is the standard for wireless LAN (WLAN). The specifications cover the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) section of the data link layer in the OSI model.

The 802.11 committee has released amendments to the standards as wireless technology has advanced. We will cover the amendments listed below:

* _802.11_: The original WLAN standard
* _802.11a_: Up to 54 Mbit/s on 5 GHz
* _802.11b_: 5.5 Mbit/s and 11 Mbit/s on 2.4 GHz
* _802.11g_: Up to 54 Mbit/s on 2.4 GHz, backwards compatible with 802.11b
* _802.11h_: Regulatory requirement to limit power and transmission in the 5GHz band
* _802.11i_: Provides enhanced security
* _802.11n_: Provides higher throughput with Multiple Input/Multiple Output (MIMO), aka Wi-Fi 4
* _802.11ac_: Very High Throughput < 6 GHz, aka Wi-Fi 5
* _802.11ad_: Multi-Gigabit in the 60GHz band, known as WiGig
* _802.11ax_: High Efficiency (HE) Wireless LAN, aka Wi-Fi 6
