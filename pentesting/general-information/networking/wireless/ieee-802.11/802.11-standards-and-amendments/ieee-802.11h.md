# IEEE 802.11h

Part of the 5 GHz spectrum is also used by radars (military, civilian, and weather radars, either fixed or mobile), unmanned aircraft systems, DoD communications, instrumentation used to track rockets, missiles, and control satellites, etc. Anything else on that frequency must be careful not to interfere with it. 802.11h provides Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) and Transmit Power Control (TPC) that are mandatory in Europe in countries regulated by ETSI for frequencies between 5.250 to 5.725 GHz.

Wi-Fi can interfere with radar for kilometers, even at low power. Here is what it looks like on a weather radar:

As soon as a radar is detected, DFS has to change the frequency for at least 30 minutes so it doesn't interfere with it. In the United States, DFS is mandated for frequencies between 5.250 to 5.350GHz and 5470 to 5.725GHz. Other countries may mandate other standards.

Let's consider one example implementation. On an enterprise access point, when certain 5GHz channels are selected, the AP scans for 60 seconds. Once it has finished the scan, it will either allow or disallow being on that channel, depending on whether or not it found a radar. Detection is complex, and not always 100% reliable in identifying signals coming from other devices who have priority.

TPC allows for decreasing the amount of power to the minimum needed to maximize coverage, minimize co-channel interference, and interference with satellites and radars.
