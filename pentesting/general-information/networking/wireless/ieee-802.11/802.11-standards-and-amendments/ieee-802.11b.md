# IEEE 802.11b

The IEEE 802.11b amendment added Complementary Code Keying (CCK), providing 5.5 and 11 Mbit/s rates on the 2.4 GHz band (operating from 2.4 GHz to 2.485 GHz) on 14 channels.

Figure 2 provides a visual representation of the 802.11b channels across the 2.4GHz frequency range.

Each channel is 22 MHz wide, and as evidenced by this figure, there is only enough spectrum for three non-overlapping channels in this frequency range.

As with any other wireless equipment, when referring to a channel frequency, we are always referring to its center frequency. The center frequency is the frequency in the center of a channel's bandwidth. For example, the range for channel 1 is 2.401 GHz to 2.423 GHz, but the we refer to its frequency as 2.412 GHz, which is at the center of this range.

Table 1 lists the center frequency of each channel.

| Channel | Center Frequency |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| 1       | 2.412 GHz        |
| 2       | 2.417 GHz        |
| 3       | 2.422 GHz        |
| 4       | 2.427 GHz        |
| 5       | 2.432 GHz        |
| 6       | 2.437 GHz        |
| 7       | 2.442 GHz        |
| 8       | 2.447 GHz        |
| 9       | 2.452 GHz        |
| 10      | 2.457 GHz        |
| 11      | 2.462 GHz        |
| 12      | 2.467 GHz        |
| 13      | 2.472 GHz        |
| 14      | 2.484 GHz        |

The channels listed in this section are based on the 802.11b amendment. However, each country allocates and regulates frequencies, transmit power, and a few other variables independently.

For example, the US and Canada allow channels 1 to 11 (12 and 13 are allowed under low power conditions) most of Europe allows 1 to 13, and Japan allows 1 to 14 (channel 14 is 802.11b-only).

Complying with these regulations is typically taken care of by the operating system, the driver of the Wi-Fi adapter, or the firmware of the wireless card.
