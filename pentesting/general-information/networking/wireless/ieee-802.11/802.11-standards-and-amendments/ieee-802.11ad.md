# IEEE 802.11ad

802.11ad is also called WiGig.

It allows communications at high speed (multi-Gigabit) of audio, video, and data and delivers speeds between 385 Mbps to 6.7 Gbit/s using SQPSK, QPSK, BPSK, 16 and 64-QAM. We won't go into a detailed explanation of these modulations here.

802.11ad allows operations in the 60 GHz band with 2.16 GHz of bandwidth. Transmissions at this frequency are absorbed by atmospheric oxygen, which limits its range.

Each 802.11ad channel has a bandwidth of 2.16GHz.

| Channel | Center frequency |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| 1       | 58.32GHz         |
| 2       | 60.48GHz         |
| 3       | 62.64GHz         |
| 4       | 64.8GHz          |
| 5       | 66.96GHz         |
| 6       | 69.12GHz         |

**Frequency Bands**

The available frequencies for 802.11ad depend on the region, meaning that some channels may not be available everywhere:

* _USA_: 57.05 GHz - 71GHz
* _Canada_: 57.05 GHz - 64GHz
* _South Korea_: 57 - 64 GHz
* _Europe, Japan, and Australia_: 57 - 66 GHz
* _China_: 59 - 64 GHz and 45 - 50 GHz (latter is also known as China Milli-Meter Wave, CMMW)
