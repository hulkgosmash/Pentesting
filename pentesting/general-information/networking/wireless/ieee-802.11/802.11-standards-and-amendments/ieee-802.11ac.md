# IEEE 802.11ac

Due to the requirement of 80 MHz channels, 802.11ac is 5 GHz only.

Optionally, 802.11ac can have up to eight spatial streams and do transmit _beamforming_ (technically, this should probably be called beam steering). Beamforming combines elements in an antenna array to steer the RF transmission in the direction of a specific device or group of devices.

802.11ac supports MCS 8 and 9 using 256-QAM but the receiver must be in close physical proximity to the transmitter. Some devices are also capable of 1024-QAM to increase rates even more. In this case, the transmitter has to be even closer (likely in the same room) since the signal required to reach those rates needs to be very strong. QAM-1024 isn't part of 802.11ac, and for that reason, hardware support is limited to certain vendors.

The interval between transmitted frames, known as the Guard Interval (GI), is 800 ns by default. It can be shortened (400 ns), which increases data rates slightly.

We won't go into Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) in this course, but here are a few basics. The number in QAM (and some other modulations) indicates how many possibilities it can represent at a time. The higher the number, the more data can be transmitted at a time. On the other end, the receiver must be able to decode the transmission. Precisely identifying the data sent without errors gets increasingly harder, thus requiring more complex hardware and a higher quality signal.

This is similar to recognizing tones of different frequencies. Discerning 16 or 32 distinct tones across the spectrum of frequencies we can hear is fairly easy, even with cheap headphones. However, in order to distinguish tones in between the ones we previously recognized, we might need headphones with better hardware to render the sounds precisely, so we can recognize them accurately. The room also needs to be increasingly quiet as well. It's the same for Wi-Fi.

802.11ac has been split in two waves, each of which brings different features. The first one is based on a draft version of 802.11ac (2.0). The second wave is based on the final version.

We need to briefly return to 802.11n for just a moment in order to discuss a key difference between Wave 1 and Wave 2. You may recall that 802.11n was MIMO. More accurately, we could have said it was Single User MIMO (SU-MIMO), though this is implied with 802.11n. 802.11ac Wave 1 is also SU-MIMO, but Wave 2 is Multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO).

SU-MIMO devices transmit to one device at a time. In an environment where an AP had three transmit streams and three devices using one stream each, the AP could not combine transmission to all devices at the same time, but only to a single device.

Wave 2 is slightly different. Using the example above, it could handle all three devices at the same time. There are other requirements such as location and compatibility with MU-MIMO. It is one-way, limited to the downlink, going toward the stations.

Wave 2 also brought 160 MHz channels or two non-contiguous 80 MHz channels. The two channels can be in separate parts of the 5GHz spectrum.

Finally, 802.11ac has the same setup for subcarriers as 802.11n: 52 are data, 4 are pilots, and the 8 are null.

**Rates**

802.11ac rates are simplified (unlike 802.11n, where the numbers kept increasing with the number of streams). All modulations are available with any number of streams and thus the MCS value goes between 0 and 9 (10 with some proprietary rates using 1024-QAM).

The same website, MCSIndex.com can be used to look up 802.11ac rates.
