# IEEE 802.11g

IEEE 802.11g uses the same signal modulation technique (OFDM) as 802.11a, but on the 2.4 GHz band. The signal range is slightly better than 802.11a, and it is backwards compatible with IEEE 802.11b. 802.11g will fall back to lower rates (and modulation) when an 802.11b device connects.

As shown below, the channel numbers and center frequencies are the same as 802.11b.

Note that channel 14 was only available in Japan for 802.11b.

802.11a/b/g sometimes uses multiple antennas but shouldn't be confused for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), which we will discuss later in this module. 802.11a/b/g is Single Input Single Output (SISO), which is the opposite of MIMO. In the case of 802.11a/b/g, the use of multiple antennas is called _antenna diversity_.
