# IEEE 802.11ax

Also known as High Efficiency (HE), 802.11ax builds upon 802.11ac and also works on 2.4 GHz. 802.11ax aims to improve the station throughput in dense environments, such as venues with a large number of devices, while still being backwards compatible with legacy 802.11 devices. 802.11ax introduces 1024QAM and Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (MU-OFDMA).

While 1024QAM allows devices to reach higher rates (up to \~1.2 Gbps per stream), the signal quality must be high in order to achieve them.

OFDMA is more efficient because it can allocate specific parts of a 20/40/80/160 MHz (or 80+80 MHz) channel to different users, thus allowing different users to transmit and receive at the same time without interference.

As mentioned earlier, OFDM can only transmit to one device at a time. OFDMA, on the other hand, can assign part of the subcarriers (and 4x smaller subcarriers, 78.125 kHz each), aka Resource Units (RU), to be more efficient and allow for other devices to transmit at the same time.

For a 20 MHz channel, there are now 256 subcarriers, or tones. Resource units allocated to different users can be as small as 26 tones (a), which make the smallest channel 2 MHz wide. Each of these resource units can have different rates, power levels, and thus bandwidth.

802.11ax has the same potential as 802.11ac in terms of spatial streams, 8x8:8. Unlike 802.11ac, this also applies to client devices, not only access points. Another difference is MU-MIMO on 802.11ac (or 802.11n) is downlink only, whereas in 802.11ax, it can be uplink as well if the client supports it.
