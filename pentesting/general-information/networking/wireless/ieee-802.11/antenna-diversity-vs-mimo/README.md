# Antenna Diversity vs MIMO

Although MIMO and antenna diversity both use multiple antennas, it is important not to get them confused with each other.

Antenna diversity is an older technology, and in the case of Wi-Fi, it meant using two antennas to improve a signal. Antenna diversity was sometimes used with 802.11a/b/g.

MIMO is a more recent wireless technology, which uses two or more antennas to transmit and receive. It has been used in 802.11n and onward, with a few exceptions.

Let's explore these two technologies in a bit more detail.
