# Antenna Diversity

Antenna diversity uses multiple antennas to improve the quality of a wireless link. It is often seen on long-haul trucks, where they have a Citizens Band (CB) antenna on both the driver and passenger side mirrors. The ideal distance between the antennas depends on the wavelength (which is calculated, in meters, by dividing 300 by the frequency in MHz). In the case of trucks and CB, the distance between the driver and passenger side mirrors is not ideal, but it still improves the signal.

Multipath propagation is an issue in wireless, where the signal bounces off objects and changes the path. Fading occurs and the signal can be different at two nearby locations. So, in the case of diversity, the receiver will use the antenna with the strongest signal.

Antenna diversity is fairly simple in comparison, and just needs to determine which antenna has the strongest signal, which could be done by checking the Modulation Error Ratio for the specific signal. In turn, when transmitting, using a single-pole, double-throw (SPDT) switch to select the antenna.

Antenna diversity is generally utilized to make improvements when receiving, but it can be used for transmitting as well.
