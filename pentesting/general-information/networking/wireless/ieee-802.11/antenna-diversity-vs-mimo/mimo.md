# MIMO

While antenna diversity selects the best (single) antenna to receive or transmit, MIMO splits the data into multiple streams and uses multiple antennas to send them. The receiver then combines the streams.

Some people get MIMO confused with Space-Time Block Code (STBC). STBC is similar to MIMO, but instead of splitting the signal in multiple parts, STBC duplicates it across multiple antennas. As a result, there is a higher chance the signal can be received in a noisy environment, where the receiver will select the best copy. Choosing either STBC or MIMO will depend on an algorithm in the transmitter.
