# The rfkill Utility

**rfkill** is a tool to enable or disable connected wireless devices. We can use it for Wi-Fi, as well as for Bluetooth, mobile broadband such as 4G/LTE, 5G, WiMax, GPS, FM, NFC, and any other radio.

Let's run rfkill list to display all the enabled Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices on the system:

```bash
sudo rfkill list
```

"Soft blocked" refers to a block from rfkill, done in software. "Hard blocked" refers to a physical switch or BIOS parameter for the device. rfkill can only change soft blocks.

A radio can be disabled (soft blocked) using rfkill block followed by the device's ID number that is displayed in the rfkill list command. Using the previous output, we will execute the rfkill command to disable our Wi-Fi device:

```bash
sudo rfkill block 1
```

If the command is successful, nothing is displayed.

We run rfkill list 1 to specifically list our disabled Wi-Fi device:

```bash
sudo rfkill list 1
```

To re-enable our Wi-Fi device we will run rfkill with the unblock parameter:

```bash
sudo rfkill unblock 1
```

We can disable all radios at the same time with the block all parameter:

```bash
sudo rfkill block all
```

And all the devices can be re-enabled using rfkill with the unblock all parameter.
