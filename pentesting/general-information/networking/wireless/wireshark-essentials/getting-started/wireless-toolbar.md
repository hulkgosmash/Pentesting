# Wireless Toolbar

The Wireshark wireless toolbar will allow us to change channels manually as well as set the channel width. This toolbar is disabled by default but can be enabled by checking _View_ > _Wireless Toolbar_.

Once selected, the toolbar gets added below the display filter toolbar.

The _802.11 Preferences_ button, at the far right of the toolbar, is a shortcut to the 802.11 protocol preferences, which contains various 802.11 settings. We'll go over these later in this module.

Wireshark doesn't _channel hop_. It will stay on whatever channel the wireless adapter is currently on. To quickly scan all channels on 2.4GHz, we can run the following shell script in the background in a terminal.

We could also use _airodump-ng_ to do channel hopping. Airodump-ng is meant to be a full-blown tool to capture wireless frames and has a handy default behavior of channel hopping without saving any data. Running sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon will achieve a result similar to the shell script above.
