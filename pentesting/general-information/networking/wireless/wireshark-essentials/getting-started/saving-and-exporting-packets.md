# Saving and Exporting Packets

After doing a packet capture, we can save the whole contents of the packet list into a file use _File_ > _Save_ or _File_ > _Save As..._. The most common format is _PCAP_. The capture file may be compressed with _GZIP_ to save disk space.

Two of the less common formats, such as _PCAPng_ and _nanosecond PCAP_, can both be accurate to the nanosecond. They are a thousand times more precise than PCAP, which uses microsecond precision. Having said this, the regular PCAP format works just fine for most scenarios and it also has excellent compatibility with other tools handling packet captures.

Wireshark offers the ability to filter what is saved to a file. We can edit this using the _File_ > _Export Specified Packets..._ option.

This is similar to _Save_ and _Save as..._ but with a number of options shown in the lower left box. Selecting _Displayed_ saves only those packets shown as a result of a currently applied filter. _Captured_ saves all the packets.

We can further refine the choice of packets using radio buttons.

* _All packets_ is the default option
* _Selected packets only_ saves one or multiple packets selected with the B key.
* _Marked packets only_ includes packets marked in the packet list by right-clicking and selecting _Mark/Unmark Packet_.
* _First to last marked_ saves all packets between the first and last marked packets.
* _Range_ includes packets that have packet numbers landing in a particular range (for example, packets 5-10).
* _Remove ignored packets_ will exclude ignored packets. To ignore a packet, we right click on it and select _Ignore/Unignore Packet_.

**Exercises**

1. Plug in your wireless card and enable monitor mode.
2. Open Wireshark and start capturing frames.
3. Enable the wireless toolbar and switch between channels 1, 6, and 11.
4. Save the capture file for later use.
