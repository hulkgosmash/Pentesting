# Getting Started

To begin, let's explore the Wireshark GUI and discuss various features and settings. Wireshark will capture Ethernet packets by default, even when we are using a wireless interface. In order to collect only raw wireless frames, the Wi-Fi adapter must be put in monitor mode prior to launching Wireshark.

```bash
sudo ip link set wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```
