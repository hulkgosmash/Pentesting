# Packet Display

Once we start the capture, packets begin appearing in our display. We can see the Wireshark window arranged into three frames.

* _Packet List_ contains a list of all captured packets with details in customizable columns containing information such as source, destination, protocol, etc.
* _Packet Details_ contains dissected details of the currently selected packet.
* _Packet Bytes_ contains the hexadecimal representation of the actual bytes of the packet. When an item is selected in _Packet Details_, the corresponding bytes are highlighted in this field.

In the upper left of our display, the toolbar now has the _Start Capture_ button greyed out. The red _Stop Capture_ button and the green _Restart Capture_ button are now active.

The packet list layout can be rearranged in various ways. Let's select _Edit_ > _Preferences_ > _Appearance_ > _Layout_ to choose another arrangement.

We can change the layout, order, or disable panes if desired. We will select the second layout, which places the _Packet Details_ and _Packet Bytes_ side by side. This will be helpful when examining the content of the frames.
