# Welcome Screen

When launched, Wireshark presents a screen like the one in Figure 1 below.

This screen displays the _Display Filter_, recently opened files, the _Capture Filter_ setup, the list of interfaces, the traffic sparklines, and other relevant information. The sparklines show network activity on each of the interfaces and they go up and down depending on the amount of traffic. Wireshark refreshes the interfaces list as they are removed or added, but it doesn't show ones that are down.

To the right of the capture filter textbox there is a dropdown that displays the different types of interfaces available. Checking and unchecking will show or hide certain interfaces based on their type. We will select _Wireless_ in order to focus on wireless only.

The options shown in Figure 2 are dynamic and depend on what is available on the current system. If there are no wireless interfaces, the _Wireless_ option will not be present. We might see other categories such as _USB_ for USB devices, _Bluetooth_ for Bluetooth devices, and _Virtual_ for interfaces related to virtualization software.

After closing the interface type selector, the list of interfaces below the capture filter textbox will update. In this case, because only _Wireless_ is selected, only the wlan0mon interface remains.

There are two ways to start the capture. We can either double-click on the interface, or we can select the interface and then click on the shark fin right below the _File_ menu. The shark fin will turn blue once we choose an interface.
