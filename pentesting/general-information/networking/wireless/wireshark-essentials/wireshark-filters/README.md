# Wireshark Filters

As we will discover, a packet capture consists of collecting a lot of data. Filters allow us to cut down on the amount of data we have to wade through so that we deal with only what is necessary or relevant. Wireshark uses two types of filters in order to limit what needs to be analyzed, _display filters_, which limit the packets that are displayed, and _capture filters_, which limit the amount of data captured.
