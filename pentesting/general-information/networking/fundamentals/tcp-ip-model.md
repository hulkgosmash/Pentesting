# TCP/IP Model

**Layer 4**: The _Application Layer_ of TCP/IP can roughly be thought of as analogous in function to the Application, Presentation, and Session layers of the OSI model. It's purpose is to answer the question "What rules should we use to determine how different pieces software can talk to each other?" HTTP, FTP, and SMTP are examples of protocols that live at the Application Layer.

**Layer 3**: The _Transport Layer_ of TCP/IP attempts to answer the question "What rules should we use to determine how machines should communicate together regardless of the networks they happen to be on?" As such, it accomplishes much of the same purpose as the OSI Transport Layer, but it also has some functions like session termination that would exist at the OSI Session Layer. It defines which _port_ information should travel to/from. We'll cover ports in more detail later on, but for now, we can think of them as virtual windows into a machine. Different network services run on different ports, allowing the machine to receive different kinds of network traffic. TCP and UDP are by far the most well known protocols at Layer 3.

**Layer 2**: The _Internet Layer_ is arguably one of the important layers in understanding how the Internet is built. Its name, after all, is what we use to call this whole enterprise of online connectivity. The Internet Layer answers the question "What rules should we use to define how information travels between networks?" It's analogous to the OSI Network Layer, and is responsible for the concept of _IP Addresses_. IP, IPsec, and ICMP are examples of protocols that exist on the Internet Layer.

**Layer 1**: The _Link Layer_ answers the question "What rules should we use to define communication within the same physical network?" It is comparable to the OSI Data Link Layer, but may also perform some functions of the Network Layer. The TCP/IP model doesn't explicitly define an OSI Physical Layer equivalent, because it assumes that protocols should be mostly agnostic to the physical instantiation of data. ARP is one of the most important Link Layer protocols, and we'll learn more about it in an upcoming unit.
